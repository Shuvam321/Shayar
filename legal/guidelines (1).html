        introducing non-factual elements into it. <br>

        content, or is defamatory, libellous, or attempts to damage someone’s reputation, or hurt their financial or
        political standing on the basis of incorrect information. We engage third party fact checkers to combat the
        menace
        of fake news basis which we proactively warn our users that a piece of content is found to be factually
        incorrect.
